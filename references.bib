@article{Washburn.2016,
 abstract = {Convergent evolution has fascinated and occasionally mystified biologists since the principle of universal common ancestry was accepted. Similar phenotypes can arise by common ancestry (including preadaptations) or through constraints in the space of possible phenotypes and can increase in a population via either drift or selection. Assessing which of these mechanisms to invoke for any given example remains challenging for both simple and complex phenotypes. However, barriers in this area are slowly breaking down with recent advances in genomics and systems biology. A renaissance in the study of convergent evolution may be on its way, as surprising explanations for similar phenotypes, such as the metabolic similarities between yeast and cancer cells, are uncovered with network and metabolic models. We argue that although examples of convergence are known from many domains of life, green plants in particular have remarkable promise for the study of convergence because they are experimentally tractable, have considerable ``-omics'' and systems biology resources available, and show convergence in a number of important and complex traits. Four such examples include the domestication syndrome, duplicate loss and retention patterns following whole-genome duplication, the multiple appearances of C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism photosynthesis, and hybrid vigor.},

Not only are there inconsistencies in usage between various authors, but even individual authors do not use these concepts in a consistent manner within their own writings. We have found at least five different notions of genome, seven of genotype, and five of phenotype current in the literature. Our goal is to clarify this situation by (a) defining clearly and precisely the notions of genetic complement, genome, genotype, phenetic complement, and phenotype; (b) examining that of phenome; and (c) analysing the logical structure of this family of concepts.},

@article{Rieseberg.2004,
 abstract = {The framework for modern studies of speciation was established as part of the Neo-Darwinian synthesis of the early twentieth century. Here we evaluate this framework in the light of recent empirical and theoretical studies. Evidence from experimental studies of selection, quantitative genetic studies of species' differences, and the molecular evolution of 'isolation' genes, all agree that directional selection is the primary cause of speciation, as initially proposed by Darwin. Likewise, as suggested by Dobzhansky and Mayr, gene flow does hold species together, but probably more by facilitating the spread of beneficial mutants and associated hitchhiking events than by homogenizing neutral loci. Reproductive barriers are important as well in that they preserve adaptations, but as has been stressed by botanists for close to a century, they rarely protect the entire genome from gene flow in recently diverged species. Contrary to early views, it is now clear that speciation can occur in the presence of gene flow. However, recent theory does support the long-held view that population structure and small population size may increase speciation rates, but only under special conditions and not because of the increased efficacy of drift as suggested by earlier authors. Rather, low levels of migration among small populations facilitates the rapid accumulation of beneficial mutations that indirectly cause hybrid incompatibilities.},

@article{ElBahrawy.2017,
 abstract = {The cryptocurrency market surpassed the barrier of {\$}100 billion market capitalization in June 2017, after months of steady growth. Despite its increasing relevance in the financial world, a comprehensive analysis of the whole system is still lacking, as most studies have focused exclusively on the behaviour of one (Bitcoin) or few cryptocurrencies. Here, we consider the history of the entire market and analyse the behaviour of 1469 cryptocurrencies introduced between April 2013 and May 2017. We reveal that, while new cryptocurrencies appear and disappear continuously and their market capitalization is increasing (super-)exponentially, several statistical properties of the market have been stable for years. These include the number of active cryptocurrencies, market share distribution and the turnover of cryptocurrencies. Adopting an ecological perspective, we show that the so-called neutral model of evolution is able to reproduce a number of key empirical observations, despite its simplicity and the assumption of no selective advantage of one cryptocurrency over another. Our results shed light on the properties of the cryptocurrency market and establish a first formal link between ecological modelling and the study of this growing system. We anticipate they will spark further research in this direction.},

We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process.},
